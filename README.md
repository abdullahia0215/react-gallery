This is my Gallery App, it took me roughly 6 hours to complete.

# Gallery App

The Gallery App is a React application that displays a collection of images and allows users to like and view descriptions of each image. It makes use of the axios library to fetch data from a server and update the gallery items.

## Features

- Display a collection of images with their descriptions
- Toggle the visibility of each image's description
- Increase the number of likes for each image
- Fetch the updated gallery items from the server after liking an image

## Problems Solved

The Gallery App solves the problem of showcasing a collection of images and allowing users to interact with them by liking and viewing their descriptions. It provides a user-friendly interface to browse through the images and engage with the content.

## Technologies Used

- React: The front-end library used to build the user interface and manage component state.
- Axios: A library used to make HTTP requests to the server and handle asynchronous operations.
- CSS: The styling language used to define the visual appearance of the app.

## Installation

To run the Gallery App locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install the dependencies: npm install --save @fortawesome/react-fontawesome AND npm install @fortawesome/react-fontawesome @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
4. Start the development server: `npm run server` and `npm run client`
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

- Upon launching the app, you will see a collection of images displayed on the screen.
